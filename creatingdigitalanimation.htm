		In digital animation we looked at two different animations and studied 
		whether they were fit for purpose. We looked at what the animations set 
		out to achieve and decided if they achieved their goal. We looked at the 
		strengths and weaknesses and if they could be improved in some way. We 
		then used this to design an animation that was related to health and 
		safety. My choice was an animation to stop smoking as I had decided it 
		was time for me to stop smoking. Being a smoker at the time I knew the 
		feeling of having to rush from the classroom, have a smoke and get back 
		to the class on time and sometimes having to stand outside in the wind 
		and the rain. The feeling was very stressful and I imagined what non 
		smokers probably&nbsp; thought of smokers going through all this just to 
		have a smoke. My idea was to put together an animation with anti-smoking 
		messages going on in the background that the viewer would acknowledge 
		subconsciously, while the main character would be dancing and smoking to 
		an eminem track called Slim shady. I kept the first part of the song 
		with the introduction in as it was but then I sampled part of the song 
		and looped so I had an empty tune to add some Rap lyrics about not 
		smoking. I did get quite far with the animation but it was not quite 
		finished. I had all the graphics prepared that I did in Adobe Photoshop. 
		I had the music done and the Rap lyrics written but then run into 
		problems with Adobe Animate. The main problem was as I imported parts 
		into Adobe Animate it knocked everything out of sync and it was a case 
		of me Reimporting everything into Adobe Animate and starting again. But 
		I ran out of time so I presented what I had finished and luckily it was 
		enough to get a grade. So all I can present you with here is the idea 
		and a screenshot of the animation. To be honest I needed much more time 
		than what was available to me to master Adobe Animate.</span></p>
