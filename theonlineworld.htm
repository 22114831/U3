		received. <br>Also we looked at the hardware that connected everything 
		together on networks including the internet, <br>We looked at different 
		types of connections to the internet by different companies. We also 
		looked at protocols that are just sets of rules about how things are 
		done over the internet. We had an exam at the end of the <br>research in 
		which I got a pass with 29 points, which was one point off merit. I was 
		disappointed with this until I realised that a large number of students 
		failed it the first time around. Then I realised it must have been more 
		difficult than I realised.</td>
