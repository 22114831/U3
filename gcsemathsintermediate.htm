		where the highest grade I could achieve was Grade C. I had the 
		opportunity to improve my grade. I would have liked to be put in for 
		Grade a but the highest the college will put you in for is Grade B. I 
		think that is because of the amount of work that is needed in such a 
		short time. Usually it would be a few years of study but we have to 
		learn it in about 9 months.<br>So the course is quite intense. You 
		really have to revise hard. I've not had my results but I'm fairly 
		confident I will achieve a grade B.</td>
