		Development unit we looked at two different websites and looked at there 
		strengths and weaknesess. we looked at the features used and the overall 
		asthetics of the websites. We then built a website called castles that 
		was a website of castles throught Wales. The main purpose of tis was to 
		learn how to use Microsoft Expression Web 4. We learnt how create 
		differnt features like creating a form and creating your own template so 
		you could achieve a feel of consistensy between the web pages on a 
		website. Also when creating a new web page from the template all the 
		basics were allready done like a banner and navigation bar.<br>We were 
		then set a task of creating a web site for a ficticous phone company. we 
		did not need to include ecommerce but we were asked to make it look 
		intersting and include a form for feedback. We were set a task of 
		including certain features within the website. We then told to upload 
		the website to the college server so that it could be hosted. However 
		our servers had problems so it was suggested to use GitHub to host our 
		website. This did present a few problems but I worked it out.<br>The website can be viewed by visiting:<br>&nbsp;<a href="https://22114831cambriaacuk.github.io/22114831.github.io/index.htm">https://22114831cambriaacuk.github.io/22114831.github.io/index.htm</a><br></td>
